# OpenAI Chat Application

This is a chat application built using OpenAI's API, designed to provide users with an engaging and intuitive conversation experience with a sophisticated AI language model. Users can chat about anything they like and receive contextually appropriate and linguistically fluent responses generated by the OpenAI API.

-   API: The application is powered by OpenAI's API to handle the natural language processing and generation of the responses.
-   Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for the backend server of the application.
-   Vite: A fast build tool used to bundle the client-side of the application.
-   Dependencies: The project depends on the following packages:
    -   cors: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for the backend server.
    -   dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file into the application.
    -   express: A minimalist web framework used for the backend server.
